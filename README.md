# Fraud Detection for E-Commerce and Banking Transactions

## Overview
Adey Innovations Inc. is developing a robust fraud detection system to identify fraudulent activities in e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions. This project leverages advanced machine learning models, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition to enhance fraud detection accuracy.

## Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess transaction data.
- Engineer meaningful features to identify fraud patterns.
- Build and train machine learning models for fraud detection.
- Evaluate model performance and implement improvements.
- Deploy the models for real-time fraud detection and set up monitoring systems for continuous improvement.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating features based on transaction patterns, user behavior, and geolocation data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Training models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Deploying models with APIs and dashboards for live fraud detection.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess models.
